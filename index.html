          <p class="p-5 border-bottom border-dark">
            Once labelled one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world
            (according to Forbes magazine), Maboneng was a golden child among
            Joburg’s regeneration stories after it was transformed from an
            industrial and factory district to a buzzing lifestyle playground.
            The development of the Maboneng Precinct began in 2008 and now, this
            colourful and youthful neighbourhood has cemented its place as a
            popular Joburg visitors attraction. Maboneng's main high street is
            Fox Street, home to the pioneer development Arts on Main and an
            eclectic selection of dozens of bars, cafe,s and restaurants.
            Maboneng has now become a major nightlife hotspot and on Saturdays
            the streets are thronged with a young party crowd.
