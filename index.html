            Commonly known as Jozi, eGoli, Maboneng. Johannesburg is the largest
            city in South Africa. It was founded in 1886 following the discovery
            of gold on the Witwatersrand. This event triggered a massive gold
            rush, attracting thousands of prospectors, labourers and fortune
            seekers from around the world. The rapid influx of people and the
            establishment of mining operations led to the city's fast
            development. Johannesburg is the economic hub of South Africa and
            the continent. It is home to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange(JSE)
            and the richest square mile in Africa - Sandton. Sandton is a
            financial district, its status as the "richest square mile" comes
            from the concetration of wealth, corporate headquaters, and
            financial activity withing a relatively small area, making it a
            symbol of economic power in Africa.

          <p class="p-5 border-bottom border-dark">
            Once labelled one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world
            (according to Forbes magazine), Maboneng was a golden child among
            Joburg’s regeneration stories after it was transformed from an
            industrial and factory district to a buzzing lifestyle playground.
            The development of the Maboneng Precinct began in 2008 and now, this
            colourful and youthful neighbourhood has cemented its place as a
            popular Joburg visitors attraction. Maboneng's main high street is
            Fox Street, home to the pioneer development Arts on Main and an
            eclectic selection of dozens of bars, cafe,s and restaurants.
            Maboneng has now become a major nightlife hotspot and on Saturdays
            the streets are thronged with a young party crowd.
