            The Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden is located in the
            western part of Johannesburg, South Africa, specifically in
            Roodepoort. This garden is one of the largest of its kind in the
            country and is known for its rich biodiversity and stunning natural
            beauty. It was named in honor of Walter Sisulu, a prominent
            anti-apartheid activist and a member of the African National
            Congress (ANC), who played a key role in the struggle for South
            Africa's liberation. The garden features a wide variety of South
            Africa’s indigenous plant species, including fynbos, savanna, a
            waterfall and several walking trails. The garden is an ideal spot
            for nature lovers, romantic picnics, family outings and those
            seeking tranquility within Johannesburg’s urban landscape.

          <p class="ps-5 pe-4 pt-4 pb-4">
            The most famous private game reserve of all. Sabi Sands, adjacent to
            South Africa's flagship Kruger National Park, offers a safari
            experience found nowhere else in the world. Game viewing
            possibilities are simply unparalleled, including the much sought
            after 'Big 5'. Add a fantastic range of luxury lodges suiting all
            tastes and an African dream safari is born. There are no fences
            between Kruger National Park and Sabi Sands, so wildlife roams
            freely in a huge natural environment. The Game Reserve is private,
            meaning that it is not accessible for day visitors. No
            self-catering, camping, or picnic facilities are available on site.
            As such, you need a booking at one of the Sabi Sands lodges upon
            entering the reserve.
